            <p>Owned by Kazai Capital Ltd, We Buy Any Home was registered with Companies House in 2013.</p> 
            <p>This fast homebuying organisation tends to take between two and three weeks to complete a property transaction, though this may be longer or shorter depending on the nature of the property and the complexity of the process involved.</p>
            <p>How much do We Buy Any Home pay clients for their properties? According to their website, it is usually possible to  sell a house to this company for between 80 and 90% of its full market value, with no legal or agency fees to pay.</p>
             <p>This claim positions offers from We Buy Any Home above the average for the fast home buying industry, which usually sits between 75 and 85%</p>
            <p>The company also has a “Highest Offer Guarantee”, which we will explore below.</p>

                  <li><h4>Pros</h4></li>
                  <li><p> So, is We Buy Any Home legit? As they are registered with The Property Ombudsman, the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) and the National Association of Property Buyers (NAPB), it appears that you can trust this organisation. Here are some of the upsides of using We Buy Any Home to sell your house:</p></li>
                  <li><img src="assets/img/thumbs-up.png" alt="thumbs-up"><p>The company claims to have been one of the founding members of the NAPB</p></li>
                  <li><img src="assets/img/thumbs-up.png" alt="thumbs-up"><p>We Buy Any Home’s reviews suggest a very good standard of service and a track record of customer satisfaction</p></li>
                  <li><img src="assets/img/thumbs-up.png" alt="thumbs-up"><p> With We Buy Any Home, fees are waived and costs associated with conveyancingand agency administration are not charged to the seller </p></li>
                  <li><img src="assets/img/thumbs-up.png" alt="thumbs-up"><p>The company has a “Highest Offer Guarantee”. According to their website, We Buy Any Home will beat any offer you may receive from another legitimate fast home  buying company</p></li>
                  
               </ul>

                  <li><h4>Cons</h4></li>
                  <li> <p>Of course, as with any organisation, there are drawbacks to using We Buy Any Home. The main issues include:</p></li>
                  <li><img src="assets/img/thumbs-down.png" alt="thumbs-down"> <p>A lack of clarity on their site surrounding their property valuing methods </p></li>
                  <li><img src="assets/img/thumbs-down.png" alt="thumbs-down"> <p>The requirements for clients to undertake    certain paperwork in order to sell their home, and the accuracy and quality of each clients’ property description has a significant bearing on the success of their sale</p></li>
                  <li><img src="assets/img/thumbs-down.png" alt="thumbs-down"> <p> The potential for confusion surrounding the    organisation’s name, as a company called  “We Buy Any House” also exists and operates within the UK</p></li>
                  <li><img src="assets/img/thumbs-down.png" alt="thumbs-down"> <p> Some obscure and unsupported claims on the company’s website, as we will explore in the “Company Summary”</p></li>
                  <li><img src="assets/img/thumbs-down.png" alt="thumbs-down"> <p>As with all fast home buying companies, you
                     will not receive the full market value of your   property if you elect to sell using this method</p></li>

         <p>On their site, the company claims to buy absolutely any home, stating: “Whether you own a flat, a bungalow, a semi, a mid-terraced or detached house, it doesn’t matter to us!”</p>
         <p>Naturally, as with any property sales specialist, the type, condition and location of the property you own will have a direct impact on the size of the offer you receive and the speed at which your home sells.</p>
         <p>Before accepting any offer, we highly recommend that you undertake your own basic research in order to determine a “ballpark price” for your property. </p>
         <p>You can do this by searching online for recent final sale prices of “comparable” properties in the local area; that is, properties of a similar size, style, layout, age and condition. </p>
         <p>You may also wish to arrange additional valuations through estate agencies or independent surveyors in order to accumulate a number of “opinions”, then find an average for a potential asking price that is as accurate as possible.</p>

         <p>The steps above will enable you to enter into discussions with We Buy Any Home with as much knowledge as possible, so that you can double check any valuation figure they provide.</p>
         <p>It is important to remember that, as most fast home buying companies make their money by purchasing property for below market value, it is highly unlikely that you will ever receive an offer of 100% from an organisation in this particular sector of the property industry.</p>
         <p>For this reason, you can usually expect to receive between 75-85% of your home’s true market value from We Buy Any Home and their competitors.</p>
         <p>If an offer of this kind will not be acceptable to you, you may wish to consider using a different method to sell your home, such as estate agency sale, private sale or auction.</p>
         <img src="assets/img/soldsale-img.png" alt="soldsale">
         <h4>Highest Guaranteed Offer</h4>
         <p>According to their website, the company will make the “highest guaranteed offer” for a seller’s property. They also refer to this as a “Best Price Guarantee”. We Buy Any Home claims that they will “beat any genuine offer” made by another company.</p>

         <p>This assertion is not clearly defined, however, and details of how it is achieved are not available online.There are no official terms for this guarantee on the company’s website. </p>

         <p>In fact, when searched via Google Images, We Buy Any Home’s “Best Price Guarantee” badge - displayed alongside those of their regulatory bodies and awards - is, in fact, a stock image that is used by multiple other firms operating in very diverse sectors around the globe.</p>
         <p>Furthermore, no clear information is displayed regarding their additional guarantee that each property
            sale will not only happen, but will happen on “the day of your choosing”.</p>
         <p>The above evidence seems to suggest that neither guarantee should be considered legally binding.</p>
         <p>To this end, we have been unable to find details of any compensation available to clients or customers whose sales have fallen through, who have not received an offer higher than figures proffered by competitors, or whose sales have not completed on or by their preferred date.</p>

      <div class=" container">
         <img src="assets/img/cashAdvance-banner-img.png" alt="soldsale">
         <h4>Cash Advance</h4>
         <p>We Buy Any Home claims to offer a cash advance to sellers who need it. However, further details of this
            assertion are not available on their site and we have not been able to find any reference to this offer in online
            reviews for the company’s services.</p>

         <h4>RICS Qualified Surveyors</h4>

         <p>As part of their process, We Buy Any Home will arrange and pay for a property survey on behalf of the seller.</p>

         <p>Throughout their website, the company claims that this will be undertaken by “a maximum of 2 RICS qualified surveyors/valuers”. </p>
         <p>However, their FAQs under the “Sell House Fast” section of the site state that they will “send three
            independent local estate agents round to value the property in person”, then take an average.</p>
         <p>In their “Our Company” section, they also state that each property will undergo just “one” valuation “by our
            RICS chartered surveyor”.</p>
         <p>It is unclear which of these statements is correct, or whether they are each true - just for different types of
            sale.</p>
         <h4>Receive Funds in Seven Days</h4>
         <p>According to their website, We Buy Any Home is able to complete a sale in as little as a week (7 days).
            However, it is more likely the process will take somewhere between 14 - 21 days, which is the average for
            this company.</p>
         <p>Details of the organisation’s internal workings are not made public on their website, so the exact procedures
            undertaken between the offer being made and the sale being completed are not absolutely clear.</p>
         <p>However, it is highly likely that much of the process will be “as standard” when selling and purchasing
            property, i.e. the obtaining and transferring of title deeds by solicitors, searches, valuations and other
            typical steps.</p>
         <p>It is worth noting that, while We Buy Any Home claims in their FAQs that the company buys property
            directly from the seller with its own funds, the CEO’s statement refers to a “network of over 20,000
            investors”. </p>
         <p>Whether or not these investors are relied upon to ensure that a sale can be secured is unclear. They may
            engage with We Buy Any Home purely as potential buyers for Buy To Let property (as is explored under
            the “Selling with Tenants” heading) rather than as a general source of funds.</p>
         <p>However, the company claims they are able to provide “evidence” that they have the funds available to
            purchase a seller’s property. The precise nature of this evidence is not explained.</p>

            net profit for the financial year was £2996,809.</p>

         <h4>Parent and Sister Companies</h4>
         <p>If you are “shopping around” for the best home buying company, it is worth noting that some brand names are managed by the same “parent” organisation. </p>
         <p>This is the case when it comes to We Buy Any Home, who are owned by Kazai Capital LTD – along with
            other companies in the same sector, including Sold.co.uk and Premium Property Buyers.</p>

         <p>There do not appear to be any hidden costs or fees when using We Buy Any Home to sell your property. </p>

         <p>However, in their FAQs under “Cash House Buyers”, it is stated that if a seller who has signed up to the
            home buying process chooses to walk away before the sale is completed, there may be a “small charge”
            to pay to remunerate We Buy Any Home for their time and resources.</p>

         <p>How this is calculated is unclear.</p>
         <p>It is also worth noting that some of the negative reviews for We Buy Any Home on Trustpilot and Google
            refer to charges received in connection with the sale of a property – sometimes apparently unexpectedly.</p>
         <p>However, as it is not possible to fully verify these claims, potential customers may choose to discuss
            matters of this kind with the company directly in order to obtain more information.</p>

            <h2>Awards</h2>
         </div>
         <p>While We Buy Any Home lists YouGov’s 2019 “Top Brand Buzz” award among its accolades, it appears  that the company was, in fact, ranked among the final three.</p>

         <p>The company also reached the final in 2020 Drum Marketing Awards “Best Financial & Professional Services Brand Marketing” category.</p>

         <img src="assets/img/awards-banner.png" alt="awards">

         <p>It seems that the customer can enjoy a good level of autonomy with We Buy Any Home; they are invited
            to discuss their specific requirements with the company from the start, and to confirm their preferred
            completion date as the process draws to a close.</p>

            <h4>Customer Feedback</h4>

         <p>While the organisation appears to be well-reviewed on Trustpilot and Google, only three reviews are displayed on the We Buy Any Home website at the time of writing.</p>
         <p>A very small proportion - just over 6% - of the company reviews on Trustpilot are negative. Poor
            communication, low valuations and a slow sales process are cited as the chief complaints. The company
            has not responded to negative reviews on this platform since May 2021.</p>
         <p>Of the We Buy Any Home’s 272 Google reviews, 47 have 1-star at the time of writing. The company last responded to negative reviews on this platform in 2021.</p>

         <h4>Social Media</h4>
         <p>We Buy Any Home posts on Facebook once every 2-3 days to a base of 3,411 followers. Their Twitter
            account - with 294 followers - appears to have been out of use since 2018. </p>
         <p>The company also has a profile on LinkedIn with 499 followers, but no posts appear to have been made
            since 2018.</p>
         <h4>Press Coverage</h4>
         <p>To date, We Buy Any Home has featured in a range of publications and on numerous television channels,
            including:</p>
